#Plant Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project focuses on automated plant disease detection using a custom Convolutional Neural Network trained on the PlantVillage dataset. The goal is to accurately classify plant leaf diseases and provide visual explanations for model predictions using techniques such as confusion matrices and Grad CAM heatmaps. The model achieves strong performance while maintaining interpretability, making it suitable for real-world agricultural applications.
